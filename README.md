* To create a normal virtualenv (example _myvenv_) and activate it (see Code below).

  ```
  virtualenv --python=python3 myvenv
  
  source myvenv/bin/activate

  (myvenv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

  (myvenv) $ python manage.py makemigrations

  (myvenv) $ python manage.py migrate

  (myvenv) $ python manage.py runserver
  ```
  
* Copy the IP address provided once your server has completed building the site. (It will say something like >> Serving at 127.0.0.1....).
* Open the address in the browser
* Don't forget to Change ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1'] in settings.py
* `Note`: It is important that when you create your virtualenv, do not create it in the same folder as the code you downloaded.
